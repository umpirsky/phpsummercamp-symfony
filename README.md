PHP Summer Camp: Symfony
========================

Well hallo there! What you have here is a starting project in Symfony, which
is similar to (but not exactly the same as) what you would have if you followed
the download instructions at http://symfony.com/download.

We'll use this project to build some cool stuff, then go watch the sunset
and hang out.

Cheers!
